# Frontend (React + Vite)

Install deps:

1. Run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.
2. To run dev server: `npm run dev`. If you created self-signed certs under `frontend/cert`, Vite will serve via HTTPS.

When using HTTPS in dev, accept the self-signed certificate in the browser. In production, use valid CA-signed certs.
