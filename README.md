# Customer Portal (React + Express + MongoDB)
This project is a secure customer portal example using React (Vite) for the frontend and Express + MongoDB for the backend. It demonstrates:

- Password hashing and salting with bcrypt
- Input whitelisting with regex (server and client)
- HTTPS development instructions (self-signed certificates)
- Common security middleware: helmet, rate-limiter, csurf, xss/mongo sanitization
- CORS configuration and CSRF handling

This repository is a starter template. Follow the backend and frontend READMEs for setup and running.
